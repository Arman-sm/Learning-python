# Learning python
In this repository I'm going to put some of my small projects while I'm learning python in Yasan academy
## Table of contents
|Project name|Short description|
|:---|:---|
|[Hoop](#Hoop)|A simple game|
|[Search by first characters](#Search-by-first-characters)|A search machine for names that works with first chars of the last and the first names
<div style="text-align: justify">
<a name="Hoop"/>

## Hoop
In this game which is an old game in my country you have to say "Hoop" after every X.
Basically you're saying hoop whenever the number can be divided by X.
By the way you have to specify this X at first.

### Example:
If we want to play it with X = 3
It's going to be like this: 1, 2, *, 4, 5, *, etc.

### Notes:
You only have 5 seconds to answer

If you either told * in the wrong spot or you told it after 5 seconds you'll lose

The academy says that the idea to create this game in python was for somebody else.

<a name="Search-by-first-characters"/>

## Search by first characters

In this project you have to specify two characters, the first one is going to be the first character of first name and the second one is going be the first character of the last name. Then the program is going to find a name based on the data you gave to it.

### Example:
Az an example you have entered "a" and "b", the program is going to give you "Ali Bahonar"

### Notes:
You can change the list (names) for different results but it was just a pre-made one for testing.
