In this repository I'm going to put some of my small projects while I'm learning python in Yasan academy

|[Hoop](#Hoop)|A simple game|

<a name="Hoop"/>

## Hoop
In this game which is an old game in my country you have to say "Hoop" after every X.
Basicaly you're saying hoop whenever the number can be divided by X.
By the way you have to specify this X at first.

If we want to play it with X = 3
It's going to be like this: 1, 2, *, 4, 5, *, etc.

Note: You only have 5 seconds to answer

If you either told * in the wrong spot or you told it after 5 seconds you'll lose

The academy says that the idea to create this game in python was for somebody else.
